Made by following the Unreal C++ course on Udemy.com

## Installation 
Clone this repository and build the solution containing FBullCowGame.cpp, FBullCowGame.h and main.h.

## How to play
The game works by letting you choose from three different difficulties, easy medium or hard. The goal is to find out the hidden word based on the clues gained from guessing before the number of tries runs out.

For example, a bull would mean that you have guess the correct letter in the correct position. A cow would mean that you have guessed the right letter in the wrong position and will need to re-position the letter in the word to find the correct position to make a bull.
